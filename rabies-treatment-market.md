<p><strong>The Rabies Treatment Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</li><li>Post-exposure prophylaxis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rabies treatment market is categorized into two key applications: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PrEP involves vaccination for individuals at high risk, such as veterinarians or travelers to endemic areas, to prevent infection. In contrast, PEP is administered after potential exposure to rabies, typically through animal bites, to avert the onset of the disease. Both approaches are crucial in controlling rabies, ensuring public health safety, and reducing the incidence of this fatal viral infection.</p></p>
