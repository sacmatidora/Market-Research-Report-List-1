<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Aluminium Alloy Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Rolling</li><li>Hot Rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile aluminium alloy plate market is primarily segmented into cold rolling and hot rolling types. Cold rolling involves passing aluminium through rollers at room temperature, resulting in thinner, stronger plates with improved surface finish and precise dimensions, ideal for automotive applications requiring lightweight components. In contrast, hot rolling involves heating the alloy before processing, allowing for easier shaping and larger thicknesses but with a rougher surface finish. Both methods cater to specific automotive needs for strength, weight reduction, and cost efficiency.</p></p>
